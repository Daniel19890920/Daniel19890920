Hi, I'm Daniel, I'm glad to be matched with you.ðŸ˜Š
I'm from Munich, Germany, and I'm currently working as an interior designer here. What kind of work do you do?
Sounds great, what kind of partner are you looking for here?
I'm looking for someone who is kind, humorous, likes to travel, and is willing to try new things with me. Of course, I hope this is a long-term relationship.
You seem like a great woman, I'm just rarely on Tinder, maybe you'd like us to add each other on WhatsApp to keep in touch.
